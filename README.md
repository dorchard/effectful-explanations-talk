# Programs that explain their effects

Material from my HaskellX Bytes (SkillsMatter) talk in London, 9th November 2017.

The examples here are supposed to be self contaiend, but can be rewritten in terms of the libraries:
   * Control.Monad.Indexed (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/category-extras)
   * Data.Type.Map (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-level-sets)
   * Control.Monad.Effect (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effect-monad)

The ideas in this talk are contained in various paper, the most pertinent being:
   * Embedding effect systems in Haskell (Orchard, Petricek 2014)
      (https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dao7/publ/haskell14-effects.pdf)
   * Parameterised notions of computation (Atkey 2006, 2009)
      (https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/34572/1/paramnotions_jfp.pdf)
