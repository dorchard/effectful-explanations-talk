# Programs that explain their effects 

Material from my HaskellX Bytes (SkillsMatter) talk in London, 9th November 2017.

The examples here are supposed to be self contaiend, but can be rewritten in terms of the libraries:
   * Control.Monad.Indexed (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/category-extras)
   * Data.Type.Map (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-level-sets)
   * Control.Monad.Effect (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effect-monad)
