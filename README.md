# Programs that explain their effects

Material from a talk given at:
  * London Haskell User Group talk, 24th January 2018.
  * HaskellX Bytes (SkillsMatter), London, 9th November 2017.

The examples here are supposed to be self contaiend, but can be rewritten in terms of the libraries:
   * Control.Monad.Effect (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effect-monad) 
   * Data.Type.Map (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-level-sets)

The ideas in this talk are contained in various paper, the most pertinent being:
   * Embedding effect systems in Haskell (Orchard, Petricek 2014)
      (https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dao7/publ/haskell14-effects.pdf)
   * Parameterised notions of computation (Atkey 2006, 2009)
      (https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/34572/1/paramnotions_jfp.pdf)
